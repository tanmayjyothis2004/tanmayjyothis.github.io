Textbooks: 1. [Durrett Probability Theory and Examples](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf) 2. [Theory of Probability and Random Processes](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-68829-7)

**CMSC320, Introduction to Data Science:** Catalogue Description: An introduction to the data science pipeline, i.e., the end-to-end process of going from unstructured, messy data to knowledge and actionable insights. Provides a broad overview of several topics including statistical data analysis, basic data mining and machine learning algorithms, large-scale data management, cloud computing, and information visualization.

**MATH405, Linear Algebra:** Second Course in Linear Algebra. Catalogue Description: An abstract treatment of finite dimensional vector spaces. Linear transformations and their invariants. 

**CMSC451, Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms:** Upper level course on Algorithms. Catalogue Description: Fundamental techniques for designing efficient computer algorithms, proving their correctness, and analyzing their complexity. General topics include graph algorithms, basic algorithm design paradigms (such as greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming), network flows, NP-completeness, and other selected topics in algorithms. 

**Previous Coursework:**

**MATH410, Advanced Calculus I:** Catalogue Description: Subjects covered: sequences and series of numbers, continuity and differentiability of real-valued functions of one variable, the Riemann integral, sequences of functions and power series. 

**STAT410, Introduction to Probability Theory:** Catalogue Description: Probability and its properties. Random variables and distribution functions in one and several dimensions. Moments. Characteristic functions. Limit theorems. Textbook: _A First Course in Probability_ by Sheldon Ross

**CMSC330, Organization of Programming Languages:** Theory of Programming Languages. Catalogue Description: A study of programming languages, including their syntax, semantics, and implementation. Several different models of languages are discussed, including dynamic, scripting (e.g., Ruby, Python) functional (e.g., OCaml, Haskell, Scheme), and memory safe systems programming (e.g., Rust). Explores language features such as formal syntax, scoping and binding of variables, higher-order programming, typing, and type polymorphism. Introduces finite automata, context free grammar, parsing, lambda calculus, and basics of security attacks and software security. 

**CMSC351, Algorithms:** Catalogue Description: A systematic study of the complexity of some elementary algorithms related to sorting, graphs and trees, and combinatorics. Algorithms are analyzed using mathematical techniques to solve recurrences and summations.

**CMSC216, Introduction to Computer Systems:** Catalogue Description: Introduction to the interaction between user programs and the operating system/hardware. Major topics include C programming, introductory systems programming, and assembly language. Other concepts covered include UNIX, machine data representation, thread management, optimization, and virtual memory. Programming is done in the Linux Environment. 

**CMSC250, Discrete Structures:** Catalogue Description: Fundamental mathematical concepts related to computer science, including finite and infinite sets, relations, functions, and propositional logic. Introduction to other techniques, modeling and solving problems in computer science. Introduction to permutations, combinations, graphs, and trees with selected applications.
